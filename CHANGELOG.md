# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

NOTE: For more granular API-specific changes, please see our [API Changelog](https://developers.klaviyo.com/en/docs/changelog_)

## [4.0.0] - revision 2023-06-15
### Added
- Accounts API is now available, this will allow you to access information about the Klaviyo account associated with your API key.
  - `getAccounts`
  - `getAccount`
  
**Note:** You will need to generate a new API key with either the `Accounts` scope enabled or `Full Access` to use these endpoints.

### Removed
- All `client` endpoints
  - `createClientEvent`
  - `createClientProfile`
  - `createClientSubscription`
## [2.0.0] - 2023-04-19

### Changed
- Fixed order of params, and added `page_size`, so some calls may need to be updated.

## [2.0.0] - 2023-04-06
### Changed
- Relationship endpoints that were previously grouped together are now split into related-resource-specific endpoints. This means that all relationship endpoints have new function names.
- Profiles API can now return predictive analytics when calling `getProfile` and `getProfiles`, by passing in `$additional_fields_profile=["predictive_analytics"]`.

### Migration Guide
- To migrate to this latest version, all calls to relationship endpoints need to be updated, as in the following example:
  - `getCampaignRelationships($id, "tags")` will become `getCampaignRelationshipsTags($id)`.
- Because PHP is sensitive to the ordering of optional args, this is a breaking change to all `getProfile` and `getProfiles` calls that use optional args. Please refer to `getProfile` and `getProfiles` in the README for more details on ordering.
  - Specifically, because params are passed in alphabetical order, even if you do not intend to use this new param, you will need to shift over the params by one by passing in `$additional_fields_profile=NULL`.

## [1.3.0] - 2023-03-01
### Added
